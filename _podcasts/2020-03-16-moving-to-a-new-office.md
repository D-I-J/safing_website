summary: "
<p>We're happy to be back publishing podcasts. Expect bi-weekly episodes for now. And we're still working on improving the audio. Step by step :)</p>

<p>Anyway, recently we moved to a new office so this was a great moment to look back at our origin story. From our \"garage story\", working tightly together at Daniel's place to how we then moved to our first and then to our current office. We also talked about meeting the mayor of Baden.</p>
