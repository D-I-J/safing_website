<p>After a failed recording last week, we're happy to share the progress on our dawning Kickstarter. With only 12 days to go we are in the middle of wrapping things up. Next to telling what we have accomplished so far Raphael and David also discuss why the campaign was rescheduled, what benefits the different supporters will receive and what still needs to be done. Enjoy the listen!</p>
