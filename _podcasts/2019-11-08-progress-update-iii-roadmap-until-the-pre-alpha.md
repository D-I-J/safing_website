summary: "
<p>This week David and Raphael share what the current roadmap has to offer. The big milestone is the release of the Safing Privacy Network (pre-alpha) in March. But there are a lot of things happening until then. Our Crowdfunding Campaign will launch on 02.01.2020. We discuss all of the things that need to happen in preparation for that - spoiler: it's a lot ;)</p>

<p>We also talk about our hopes of the 20s being the decade where we as a society can turn the Internet around. Enjoy and thank you for listening!</p>
