summary: "
<p>Accepting payments as a privacy company is not as straightforward as it might seem. Instead of ignoring privacy issues as most companies do, we feel the best way to protect any user data is to not collect it in the first place. On the other hand we have legal requirements we need to fulfill. Finding the best solution requires a lot of thought. Additionally, being a privacy company means that many payment vendors are not too keen to provide us with their services. Raphael and David sit down and have an extensive talk about all of these aspects.</p>
