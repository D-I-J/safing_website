<p>How does the it feel after researching and developing a product for more than three years when it finally sees the light of day? Daniel shares his feelings in regards to the recent Portmaster launch, we question whether or not we should have shipped earlier and we talk about the next steps in this new era. Have a wonderful week!</p>
