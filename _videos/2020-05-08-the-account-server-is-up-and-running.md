### Description

Hey there, the Safing Account server is up and running. üôå  
<https://account.safing.io/>

It's the place where you can manage and sign up to your SPN/Safing account. Next to payments, the server also manages the current waitlist and the future SPN authentication. Authorization will happen on another server, but that's another story.

For all you Kickstarter backers, your are already first in line! We'll send you instructions how to set up or link your accounts in a few weeks.
