          Raphael noticed that online - everywhere he went - he was treated like a 1st class citizen. He soon realized: when he received benefits he did not earn, someone else had to pay to cover the costs. His responsibility is developing and managing our business. He also takes care of networking, company culture and accounting.

## Privacy First

The [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT&from=EN) clearly states in Article 8:

<blockquote>
  <p class="text-light">
    Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Privacy is *your right*, we want to do our part to make it easier for you to reclaim that right!

## Open Source

To ensure maximum privacy and transparency we need to be open in every aspect. That's why we [publish all of our hard work]({{ site.github_url }}) as open source. This way you and others can validate if we truly stay to our word. But we do not want to stop there.

## Ethical Funding

Taking money always means opening up to influences. That is why we see it as our responsibility to be thoughtful about taking investments. We do not want parties to gain influence which do not or might not stand behind our values. That is why in our current funding phase we took more personal risks instead of selling parts of our company for easy money.

### Transparent Funding Policy

For us, ethical funding also means we want to make sure that our users know who paid for the programs and services they use.

As a result we openly share how we are funded. All our funding (and partnerships) will remain public!

<h2 id="influences">Influences <small class="text-lighter">updated November 2019</small></h2>

<p>This section shows what influences the company is exposed to. This includes received funding, partnerships, supporters, trainings and other things.</p>

## Clear Business Model

Instead of pushing a free product and worry about the business model later, we wanted to have a strong foundation and have this figured out right from the start:

The subscribers of our Safing Privacy Network will be our main source of income. As soon as we can carry ourselves with SPN, we will further develop privacy enabling, open source tools. One such product in the pipeline is a free Application Firewall, which will block malicious outgoing connections.

<p>If you like what we are all about, consider supporting us by subscribing to SPN or <a href="{{ site.reddit_url }}">engaging in our community!</a>
