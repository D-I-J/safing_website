Hey there! We're looking for a UX designer to join us at Safing, maybe that's you?

<div class="ui stacked segment">
  <p>
    We're on a mission to enable online citizens to withstand todays surveillance capitalism, so everybody can reclaim their privacy and enjoy <a href="{{ site.cyberfreedom_url }}">#cyberfreedom</a>.
  </p>
</div>

We aren't striving to become a unicorn 🦄 which we can then sell off for a huge profits. Rather, we strive to being a sustainable business and having a meaningful impact in todays Internet landscape. We take our mission seriously, so we are not only [open sourcing our products]({{ site.communities.github.url }}), but are also open about [our fundings]({{ site.our_values_url }}#ethical-funding), [influences]({{ site.our_values_url }}#ownership) and [business model]({{ site.our_values_url }}#clear-business-model).

Safing develops [three tools]({{ site.technology_url }}), which in unison equip everyday online citizens to withstand surveillance capitalism. We're not solving every privacy problem out there, but we believe our approach tackles some root problems and will have a massive impact on peoples lives!

As we're beginning to hire our first employees, we are looking for people who complement our team, filling in areas where we have our greatest needs & weaknesses: UX Design.

## What we're looking for
----------------

This is a broad role which primarily involves improving - and maybe completely revamping - our user interfaces at Stamp, Portmaster, Gate17 as well as our homepage. Both our developing founders come from the backend and somehow muddled together our current UX. We're certain we can learn a lot from you!

You'll take responsibility over this field, hence you will have a great impact in our UX and our online presence from day one. We will help you and guide you into this role until you can take over yourself.

We do have [partners](https://infound.at) who created our website layout and theme-world assets. You might also collaborate with them from time to time.

Since we are a small team with lots of responsibilities, it will help if you are flexible and willing to adapt into related areas _which you like_. This might include frontend design (HTML/CSS), asset design, frontend development (Vue.js) etc...
This will happen naturally, and only after you feel comfortable in your current role, but we felt the need to point that out beforehand - we still are in the startup phase.

Also, be prepared to collaborate with additional team members in the next year(s). We do have plans on expanding the team further, but again, all should flow naturally.

#### What this role involves:

- 🎨 Creating user interfaces for all our products
- 🗣 Communicating with both the community as well as the developers to improve your art of creating beautiful user interfaces
- 👩‍💻 Lots of freedom to take control of your process, iterating and learning what works (and what doesn't)
- 🚀 Growing into the team and growing with the team as our products evolve into giants
- 🌟 Having a real impact on products used by people around the world to protect their privacy and enjoy [#cyberfreedom]({{ site.cyberfreedom_url }})

#### We're looking for someone who is

- **burning for our mission**
- **independent:** we are a small team requiring a lot of independent work - this does not mean you will not receive help & guidance, but we cannot constantly watch you over your shoulder and tell you how things need to be done
- **a good communicator:** we are on the verge of becoming a remote team, one of our founders will soon start working remotely, so expressing yourself in writing is a must
- **creative:** we love people who can think out of the box and think of different ways of solving problems
- **opinionated & humble:** we value people standing up for their ideas, yet are also happy to discard their former opinions when a better way of doing things presents itself
- **happy to talk with our users:** we are here to serve the people, hence it is crucial that you are interested in what they have to say

## Jobs at Safing come with
----------------

- 🔥 making an impact
- 💵 28.000€ - 42.000€ annual salary
- 💻 a fully paid setup
- ⚖️ work-life balance: it has importance since we're in this for the long run, this is a marathon
- 🔍 transparency: as one of [our core values]({{ site.our_values_url }}#open-source), this is both true internally and externally
- ⚡️ modern technology
- 🌎 remote work (optional)
- 🏢 an office located in [Baden, Lower Austria](https://osm.org/go/0JqQPzY?node=34103911) (optional)

## How to apply
----------------

All jobs at Safing start with your application via email, where you can tell us a little bit about yourself. After that, we'll have 1-2 short interviews and you'll hear from us within a week. If it's a good fit for both of us you can immediately start out with a paid trial (spanning 3 months), leading into full employment thereafter.
