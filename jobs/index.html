                We love freedom, just like you. We are on a mission to help everyone 
                withstand today’s mass surveillance so they can reclaim control over 
                their data. Play an active part in tackling some of online privacy’s 
                root problems and have a huge impact on people’s lives!

                    You’ll have a fully paid setup with the latest technology and 
                    ergonomic office furniture. We are currently in a beautiful 
                    office in Baden, Lower Austria, but there is the possibility 
                    to work remotely. Unfortunately, this is restricted to Austria 
                    as of now. However, we will help you with settling in Austria 
                    if you decide to join us.

                    Development is often tied to long working hours. That is why we 
                    want to you to have enough time for recreation. Austria is a 
                    great workplace where you will enjoy health insurance and five 
                    weeks of paid vacation. Additionally, all new parents have the 
                    possibility to take family leave, regardless of gender.

                    Safing’s drive comes out of conviction and commitment to the 
                    cause of privacy, not for generating profit. We strive for 
                    creating sustainable high quality software solutions to 
                    serious problems. This requires constant growth and 
                    consistency. If this resonates with you, you’re welcome to

                    Handling sensitive data requires a lot of trust. Help us 
                    building this trust by contributing to our code base. Open 
                    Source is a way of being transparent and gives other the 
                    opportunity to hold us accountable. Be the additional pair 
                    of eyes that increases our transparency.
