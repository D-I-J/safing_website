            We are a bunch of ordinary people who want to change the world. Discontent with 
            the global state of mass surveillance, and seeing how it negatively impacts our 
            lives, we decided it was time to do something about it.
            <br>
            <br>
            We still have a long way to go. We hope you'll join the journey.

              The Internet is one of the most beautiful things there is.
              But every connection has the potential to betray you, leaking
              personal information you never wanted to share. That's where
              we intercept.
