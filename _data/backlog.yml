      - Reintroduce the "Prompt Mode" which asks for your input whether or not to allow a connection. Naturally, make it possible to lock in a decision for the future.
    projects:
      - Portmaster
  - title: Network Trust System
    description:
      - Remember which networks you trust and activate additional defenses in untrusted networks, like the Wi-Fi of your favorite coffee shop.
      - Breathe some life into the Autopilot system and automatically switch to a heightened security level in untrusted networks.

    description:
      - Instead of only viewing what is currently going on, save a local history to be able to inspect what apps did in the past. Naturally, this is local only.
      - Also, provide a simple opt-out.
  - title: TLS Inspection
    description:
      - The TLS protocol not only has many problems by itself, but is also often used fatally wrong by software developers.
      - Inspect TLS traffic to ensure that the used encryption is good and check all certificates both for validity and for a potential nullification.
      - Enable you to set or cut down on the amount of trusted Root Certification Authorities.

    projects:
      - SPN
  - title: Connection Resiliance & Stability
    description:
      - Insert more resilience into SPN connections, so that even when your Internet goes down for a bit or a used node fails, the Portmaster will still be able to revive and continue your connection as if nothing happened.
    projects:
      - SPN
  - title: Multi-Path Connections
    description:
      - Enable connections to go over multiple paths simultaneously, which will increase the maximum possible bandwidth within the network.
      - Utilize this functionality to route all your SPN traffic through multiple Internet uplinks at the same time.
    projects:
      - SPN
  - title: Routing Profiles
    description:
      - Make it possible to prioritize either speed, privacy or latency when using the SPN. Permit configuration per app/security level.

  - title: IP Leak Protection
    description:
      - Block known services that want to snoop your IP address.
      - Also actively inspect SSDP, UPnP, Bonjour/Zeroconf and TURN in order to stop them from leaking your IP address.
