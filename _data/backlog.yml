  - title: TLS Inspection
    description:
      - The TLS protocol not only has many problems by itself, but is also often used fatally wrong by software developers.
      - Inspect TLS traffic to ensure that the used encryption is good and check all certificates both for validity and for a potential nullification.
      - Enable you to set or cut down on the amount of trusted Root Certification Authorities.
