      Raphael noticed that online - everywhere he went - he was treated like a 1st class citizen. He soon realized: when he received benefits he did not earn, someone else had to pay to cover the costs. His responsibility is developing and managing our business. He also takes care of networking, company culture and accounting.

      Daniel studied IT-Security. At his first job, his skills led him to become the system architect of the first Austrian cyber attack simulation platform. Ever since the Snowden revelations he invested most of his free time to conceptualize privacy solutions. He is the brain behind Portmaster and the Safing Privacy Network and is the lead developer.

      With his broad skillset, from app development to low level programming, Vladimir quickly became a valuable part of the team. Loving both privacy and challenges, he is unafraid to tackle the tricky areas of Portmaster in order to push it forward.
