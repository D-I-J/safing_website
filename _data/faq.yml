spn:
  - q: Is the SPN out yet?
    a: "The SPN is currently in a closed pre-alpha with our earliest Kickstarter backers (MARVIN & VISIONARY). A status page to inform you of the networks status, its size and number of users is planned. We will link to it from here as soon as it is out."
  - q: When can I use the SPN?
    a: "There are two key factors. The most important metric is development: the faster we progress the faster you get access. From our recent experience with the Portmaster, we know it will take weeks or months until it matures enough to progress into the \"alpha\" stage. The second key factor is your place in the waitlist. Everyone who pre-ordered got enqueued and we will gradually let more people into the network. Feel free to pre-order too or wait until we open the network for instant access."
  - q: Is the SPN like Tor?
    a: The SPN is heavily inspired by Tor, but the mission is different. Next to tightly integrating with other privacy modules, the main focus of the SPN is easy protection for your whole computer, not just your browser. Additionally it spreads your connections across the globe instead of routing everything through the same circuit.

  - q: How does the SPN compare to VPNs?
    a: The VPN technology was built to securely connect two company locations. However, the SPN was developed from the ground up to protect user privacy. As a result the SPN can easily outperform VPNs in every aspect.

  - q: Are all connections routed through the SPN?
    a: Yes, when enabled the Portmaster routes all Internet connections through the Safing Privacy Network.
  - q: Does the SPN route all connections individually? So every connection exits on a different node?
    a: Yes. Every connection is routed separately, giving you a vast amount of identities (IP addresses).

  - q: Does the SPN route connections on a per app basis?
    a: No, it routes every connection individually. So as an example, when you open several websites in different tabs in your browser, every connection will be calculated individually.
  - q: Am I totally safe from tracking with the SPN? What do service providers see when connecting through the SPN?
    a: No. This is just one piece of the puzzle. The SPN only protects your IP-address from exposure, but there are still many other ways services can track and identify you. These include fingerprinting (mostly in browsers), authentication (when logged in to a service), mouse movements (malicious javascripts), etc...
  - q: Can services still identify me through other methods?
    a: Yes, this is just one piece of the puzzle. There are multiple ways services track you, like browser fingerprinting, malicious javascripts, etc... And if you log into services, such as your Google account, they will mostly still know it is you, even though you protect your IP address.
  - q: Does the SPN only protect my browser?
    a: The SPN reroutes all your computers connections, including those of your browser.
  - q: Can I safely log in to sites via the SPN? Like my bank account etc?
    a: Yes. All serious websites use secure https connections, which encrypts the content of your connection (like login credentials) before the Portmaster wraps them in onion encryption. So no ISP architecture or SPN exit node will be able to manipulate that data. It is protected by https all the way to the destination server.
  - q: What platforms will you support?
    a: Since the SPN is integrated into the Portmaster, for our the pre-alpha stage we will only support Windows and Linux. Mac and Mobile are planned, but are further down the road.
  - q: Is there a free trial version for people interested in the SPN?
    a: No. Providing the network costs us money, so we charge accordingly. However, the privacy filter and DNS Resolver, which add a great value to your privacy, are and will remain free to use.
portmaster:
  - q: Since the Portmaster can block ads and trackers, do I still need an ad-blocker for my browser?
    a: Yes, we highly recommend to continue using adblockers, such as uBlock Origin, uMatrix, or similar. They give you more fine grained control over domains. iE you can allow certain domains to allow css files & images while blocking cookies & javascripts. The Portmaster cannot make this distinction.
  - q: What platforms do you support?
    a: Currently we support Windows and Linux. Mac and Mobile are planned, but are further down the road.
