      ### The Solution

      We provide you with a simple but powerful tool that manages your connections to the Internet for you. On top of that we make sure that the data sent out is protected from prying eyes on the way to its destination. All this helps to [protect your privacy](/our-values) as best as possible.

      ### Portmaster - Application Firewall

      The Portmaster ensures that applications only send data to service providers you trust. This way your device leaks no data. To ensure usability and effectiveness the firewall has pre-configured application profiles which know which connections are required for an optimal and private experience.

      ### Gate17 - Secure Network

      The Gate17 Network ensures that the data you send out is safe and private. While active, all your traffic is routed through the secure network, which makes your Internet traffic private and anonymous. As a result websites you visit do not know who you are (unless you tell them) or where you are located, nor does your Internet service provider know where you connect to. And because your privacy is our top priority we built the whole system in such a way, that not even we can feasibly retrace the connections you made.
