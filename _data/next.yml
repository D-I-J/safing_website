# Project Priority (for ordering)

# - SPN
# - Website (includes the CustomerHub)
# - Community
# - Marketing
# - Back Office

# Ordering of team members should lean towards most involved -> least involved. but may also be done randomly

# Description style:
# - write in the perspective of a manager giving orders. Add this, redesign that, Request X.
# - when talking about users, customers, readers, ... ALWAYS switch to the "you" perspective.
#   -> NO: Create a roadmap so users know what is going on.
#   -> YES: Create a roadmap so you know what is going on.

      description:
        - You can see our high level concepts & you can inspect our code. But nothing in between.
        - Fill that gap by providing proper documentation of the Portmaster. What does each component do? With what other components does it interact? Where is its code located?

    - title: Rethink Website Communication
      description:
        - New people visiting our website still have a hard time figuring out what we do at a glance. Instead of explaining everything at once, simplify our entry-level communication and move more complex stuff into according sub pages.
