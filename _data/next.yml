# Ordering of team members should lean towards most involved -> least involved. but may also be done randomly

# Description style:
# - write in the perspective of a manager giving orders. Add this, redesign that, Request X.
# - when talking about users, customers, readers, ... ALWAYS switch to the "you" perspective.
#   -> NO: Create a roadmap so users know what is going on.
#   -> YES: Create a roadmap so you know what is going on.

      description:
        - "With over 200+ tasks in the Backlog it has become infeasible to prioritize effectively. As an example: choosing from 20 urgent tasks is rather absurd. Restructure our project management so everyone can work efficiently."
