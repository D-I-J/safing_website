## We're Doing an AMA

As a company we believe in listening to our users and engaging with them frequently. We want to create products that actually give you the tools you need to reclaim your privacy online.
This is why we asked the folks over at [r/PrivacytoolsIO](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/) if we could do an AMA (Ask Me Anything) to get your feedback and give you more insights into what we are up to and why we do what we do in the first place.

## Friday, September 18 at 14:00 UTC

is when we will be kicking this off __on the [r/PrivacytoolsIO](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/) Subreddit__. Don't be disappointed if you won't be able to make it to the start, as __it will run for a whole week__ through September 25.

Come and __literally ask us anything__. We are a transparent company and want to live up to that! We want to listen to what you have to say and discuss ways we can better help you reclaim your online privacy.

If you want a __reminder__, you can subscribe to our [newsletter](#newsletter), or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SafingIO), or join [our Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/safing/).  
We will send out reminders when it launches.

If you're late to the party, don't fret.  
We always love to read an email from you, just send it to [hello@safing.io](mailto:hello@safing.io).
