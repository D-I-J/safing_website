# Community

Privacy isn’t a 'one shoe fits all' kind of thing. And we do not claim to have an all-encompassing solution. You will need more than what we provide to get the best privacy possible. So, we create spaces where you can talk about all things privacy.


# Blog

<!-- It would be too much to publish our every thought on our main homepage. So, we share our ideas and discuss topics - all related to privacy - here. -->

For everything too long for a tweet or even a forum post, we keep it old school with a blog.
Over there, you might find some think pieces, product announcements and similar stuff.
