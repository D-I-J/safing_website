Take Back Control of Your Data! 


# PM

The Portmaster enables you to protect your data on your device.
You are back in charge of outgoing connections, you choose what data is allowed to be sent.
Now you can use all applications without sacrificing privacy nor features.


# G17

<!-- With Gate 17 the data you send out into the open internet is secured.
Your data is encrypted on your device and sent out into the world through our secure network. Each connection on its very own path, calculated to minimize exposure on the open web and maximize your privacy. Because each connection is handled and routed separately you leave the network on multiple places at once!


Start with a value – like with PM!  -->


Gate17 lets you stay private while surfing the Web.
Now you are in charge of where your traffic is going, you can handle each connection separately, choosing where it shall leave the network.
It gives you the power to appear at multiple places on the web at once.


# Privacy first

For us, privacy isn’t a feature – it’s the foundation we build our products on.
We make sacrifices on all other fronts to protect your privacy and push the limits of technology to do so.


# Opensource & Ethical Funding – Transparency

Because privacy requires trust, transparency is a major topic for us, therefor we release our code as Opensource.
But Transparency can’t just stop there. To show you our commitment to the path we are taking we are fully transparent about our funding and partnerships.


# Community

Privacy isn’t a one shoe fits all kind of thing. And we don’t claim to have an all-encompassing solution. You will need more than what we provide to get the best privacy possible. So, we create spaces where you can talk about all thing’s privacy.


# Blog

<!-- It would be too much to publish our every thought on our main homepage. So, we share our ideas and discuss topics - all related to privacy - here. -->

For everything to long for a tweet or even a forum post we keep it old-school with a blog.
You might find some think pieces, product announcements and similar stuff in here.
