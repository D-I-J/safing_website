Safing ICS Technologies GmbH is participating in the ESA Business Incubation Centre Austria. The goal is to advance our technology as well as our business. Additionally, we have access to advanced ESA technology which will help us with anomaly detection.

The ESA-BIC is a cooperation between the Science Park Graz, located in Styria, and the EFRE - of the State of Lower Austria. Over the incubation timespan, we receive coaching as well as 50.000â‚¬ in funding. Half of it is contributed by the ESA-BIC while the other half is granted by the EFRE.
