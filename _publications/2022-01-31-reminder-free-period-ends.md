Just a quick reminder to all SPN customers. Your free period will end tomorrow, February 1st, 2022.

To continue using the SPN, please sign in to your SPN account and hit the "activate" button which **will appear tomorrow, February 1st.**

During the free period we pushed plenty of improvements and hope you are happy with the [current speeds and experience](https://docs.safing.io/spn/alpha/status).

Thanks for your support!
