# Progress Update blogs make a snapshot of the current next page
# and then add a "progress: description" to it.
# -> this is cool for history purposes

# And in there, describe the progress, challenges, cool moments etc..
# You may always refer to previous blog posts to get an idea.
# if a project gets completed / abandoned, add a finish date

# also set this attribute to true so the website does its magic with it

    - title: SPN Pre-Alpha
      description:
        - Deploy the SPN in v0.1. Give access to Marvin and Visionary Kickstarter backers.
        - Communicate that this is only the first step and that it will take a few weeks or months until the network is stable enough to support hundreds/thousands of users.

          text: Getting the SPN out was painful, but so relieving. We planned to launch in June, then July and in the end it ended up being beginning of August. Yes, this is natural as things take time, but nevertheless was it stressful. So we are very happy that we finally got it out!

          text: "The SPN is buggy in its current form, but this too is normal. We lived through the same when the Portmaster launched back in April. Looking back, we are amazed at how the product matured technically in the last couple of months. The same will happen with the SPN, so after a short gasp of relief, we are back rolling up our sleeves: a lot of bug fixing lies ahead of us."
    - title: IntelHub
      description:
        - Create a service that aggregates filterlists, updates this intelligence frequently and distributes it to Portmaster clients so they do not have to do this resource heavy work themselves.
        - Also aggregate and distribute IP address meta-data like ownership and location (GeoIP) so the SPN module can calculate optimal routes through the SPN.

          text: Patrick tackled most of the workload in July and in the beginning of August, enabling him to run and test the IntelHub for a few weeks in a staging environment. After inspecting the process and some fine tuning, it now is online, serving Portmasters around the world.
    - title: Next Page & Backlog
      description:
        - Properly communicate what we currently are working on so you know what to expect from us in the nearer future.
        - Also provide a backlog to acknowledge everything that needs to be done further down the road. Encourage participation so you can easily let us know where we might need to adapt or what we might have missed in the bigger picture.

          text: "Don't know about you, but we love the next page! David was a bit bummed out when communication around SPN took his focus away from the backlog. This resulted in a bit of a delay, but right after that tangent, he quickly pushed this forward. As it concluded, we are happy that everybody can have a big-picture overview of our mid- & longterm plans."

        - You can see our high level concepts & you can inspect our code. But nothing in between.
