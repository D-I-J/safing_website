summary: "<p>Which privacy service deserves your trust? Often you will hear things like good security or if the code is open source. But as always, it has a lot to do with money. Who pays in the end?</p>
<p>In today's episode we welcome no other than TheHatedOne (Privacy YouTuber), who joins us to discuss business models.</p>
<p>Why are they important? How can a service be financially sustainable? And out of Signal and GrapheneOS, which one does a great job while the other is set up in a questionable manner to say the least.</p>
