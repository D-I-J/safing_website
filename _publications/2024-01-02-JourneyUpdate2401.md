### We Hit the Milestone: Safing is Now 100% Subscriber Funded, Thank You for Your Support!

To be honest, back in October, we were unsure if sharing [the situation Safing](https://safing.io/blog/2023/10/19/JourneyUpdate2310/) was facing was the right move. We didn't want to cause alarm, but at the same time, we recognized the need to increase Safing's revenue to avoid downsizing and slowing progress. We feared this could signal the beginning of the end.

Thankfully, that's not the case. Just three months later, we've hit a crucial milestone for the first time: Safing is now 100% funded by our subscribers! 

We're aware this might be a peak, and the coming months could see a decrease, but reaching this milestone is still a significant achievement. We're extremely grateful for all the support we've received from you!

### The Android App Is Next

We know many of you are eager for us to expand to new platforms, and Android is next on our list. As soon as we consistently meet the 100% target for Safing's current size month by month, we can start planning for a new team member who will focus on completing the Android version.

I don't want to make any predictions right now, as it's hard to say if this high will sustain. We've observed in the past that November and December are stronger months (similar to retail) but usually followed by a start-of-the-year dip and a summer dip as well.

We will keep you updated, and your feedback is always welcome!

### Here's Also a Video Thank You From Me :D
