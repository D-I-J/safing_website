ALWAYS THINK ABOUT RETENTION - leave out what isn't catchy. Rather too little which is thrilling than too much which may just be content that I or we want to be heard.

How can I shorten things?

### In Olden Days, the Internet Was Still "Perfect"

The year was 2013. The Internet was still this amazing place where anything was possible: You could hang out and chat with your friends. You could also debate with strangers from all over the world. Or you could simply go ahead and discover new and quirky websites every day. In the end, you could just be you - without anybody ever spoiling the fun.

There were talks about bad actors, true, but those were dismissed by the large public. It all still had this innocent vibe. I myself was the biggest Google fanboy out there and never questioned all of the trust I put in them; my whole digital life had a home with Google, and nothing was ever going to stop me. Why talk about rain when sunshine clearly is filling the sky?

This all reminds me of the movie "The Truman Show". Truman, the main character, lives a perfect life: Great job, happily married and his best buddy is there for him anywhere, anytime.

But what he does not know yet - is that he is the main character in a massive reality TV show. His entire life is being broadcast to the entire world. He is being exploited and monetized without his knowledge or consent.

All along, Truman always thought he controlling his life. But since his childhood he was pushed towards the goals of the show runners. He was manipulated. Without ever noticing.

### But Something Was Off

And then - just like us - Truman has his "Snowden moment". The moment he realizes something is just not right. Something is off. And even though he knew his perfect world was about to crumble, he could no longer look away. He had to face the truth.

### Snowden Revealed How Threatened Our Freedoms Are

In summer 2013, the Snowden Revelations unarguably showed that mass surveillance is happening on a global scale. Right in front of our eyes.

And still, to this day, citizens across the world are being spied upon. They are monetized, exploited and sometimes even persecuted because of what they say or do online.

At the same time, little or no transparency is given about the programs of mass surveillance and how they are being utilized. The same applies to big-tech algorithms. In hiding, they decide what billions of people see every day.

As such, mass surveillance is a threat to our democracies and freedoms.

Snowden did not stop these programs, but his revelations made it impossible for the world to continue looking the other way. So while things did not change or even got worse, Snowden still changed the world. He changed everything. He changed our perception.

### We Quit Our Jobs to Develop Privacy Full-Time

And that is where our story begins. Because of Snowden, along with millions of others, we started seeing and discussing the issues of our modern age. And mass surveillance is a complex problem. Super complex. It is a problem that needs to be tackled on many different fronts; be it legislation, regulation, education or with software.

After lots of thought, three guys from Austria quit their day jobs to fully invest their time into creating privacy solutions for the masses. They founded a company named Safing.

> \- to make something safe

### Privacy Was Hard - There Had to Be a Better Way!

Us three being quite the nerds, we knew there were ways to protect yourself from mass surveillance. The only problem: it was hard and technical. For everyday people it was just not realistic to easily protect yourself from mass surveillance.

Too much hassle was involved. We knew there HAD to be a better way. Was it too much to ask wanting our moms to be able to manage their own privacy? It SHOULD be that easy. That is what Safing was all about. Making privacy easy for the masses.

### From A Spare Room With Crude Desks to an Office With Employees

So we just went for it and quit our well-paying jobs. To start out, we set up base in a spare room in one of our homes. We moved some crude desks inside and got going.

Many obstacles lied ahead. Financing our research and development phase with no income yet. Hiring our first amazing! employees. Creating company culture. Building team structure. Getting our first "alpha" users. And of course, moving from that spare room into our first office.

Man, what a day with big smiles!

### With an Amazing Team and "Alpha" Testers, We Reached 1.0

Things sped up since. With an amazing team, as well as countless efforts from privacy enthusiasts - who used and tested our software from the earliest days - we could mature and develop Portmaster into what it is today.

What started out as a dream, a dream caused by the Snowden Revelations, is now a dream which became reality.

With version 1.0, Portmaster does the heavy lifting for you. It is an install & forget solution. Perfect for beginners, like my mom. At the same time, advanced users can configure everything to their hearts desire.

We are super proud to have made it this far!

### Reception Made It Clear: People WANT Privacy

And do not take our word for it. If anything was made clear through our journey, it is that people WANT privacy, if they can easily get it.

Just look at what happened to our [GitHub stars]({{ site.github_url }}/portmaster) when we got to 1.0 - can you spot when it happened?

![image s howing the three co-founders in the first empty office - big smiles!]({{ site.img_url }}blog/snowden/star-history-20221125.png)

The masses do not want their entire lives to be surveilled by default. It is just that they did not have a realistic choice so far. And this is about to change.

Portmaster is not ending with version 1.0. There are still tons of features planned, and we want to continue to make things simpler and simpler. To grandma and beyond!
