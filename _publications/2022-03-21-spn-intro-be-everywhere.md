Do you want to protect your online privacy? The Safing Privacy Network might be the solution for you! The SPN is a secure overlay network similar to Tor, but is just as easy to use as a VPN.

The SPN is built to spread your connections across the globe, giving you multiple identities (IP addresses) for each application. This reduces visibility in the “open web” and protects your connections from mass surveillance.
