In October 2020 one of our supporters joked around and said he would gift us a video game if he got access to the [SPN]({{ site.spn_url }}) before Christmas. I am happy to announce we technically made it.

### All Customers Now Get SPN Access ðŸŽ‰

Yes, as of today, all customers get access to the [SPN]({{ site.spn_url }}). Whether you pre-ordered the SPN a while ago or are going to purchase it today. You are in!

### To Celebrate, All Customers Can Use the SPN For Free in December + January

This is an exciting moment for all of us. To celebrate and to say thanks, all customers can [use the SPN for free](https://account.safing.io/spn-reaches-alpha) throughout December 2021 and January 2022. Every paying person, new or old, gets automatic access.

Of course the free SPN access will not charge for your paid subscription. Only after the free period you will decide when to start your paid subscription.

### Watch the SPN in Action

</p>

### Check Out the SPN's Current Status

Since the SPN is in "Alpha", we highly recommend you [check out the current status and capabilities of the SPN](https://docs.safing.io/spn/alpha/status).

#### Switch Your Release Channel to Get the Newest Updates

Both the Portmaster and the SPN receive stable updates every few weeks. But in reality, improvements and fixes are pushed even faster. You can switch your [Release Channel](https://docs.safing.io/portmaster/settings#core/releaseChannel) to "Beta" in the Portmaster settings to get access to all improvements sooner.

#### How To Report Bugs

If you stumble across bugs, please report them to the [SPN repository on GitHub](https://github.com/safing/spn/issues) or send us an email to <support@safing.io>.

### A Long, Research-Heavy Chapter Concludes

The Portmaster and the SPN have been years in the making. Safing is nearing its 5th anniversary, and concepts of these privacy solutions go even further back. Needless to say we are excited for this new chapter.

#### Expect Lots of Incremental Updates From Here On Out

In this new chapter, we no longer have to _build new products_, but we can _improve existing products_. The products still have their quirks, and our research is not done, but now we can focus our efforts on improving the tools.

So expect plenty of bug fixes, better technical stability and user experience, and of course some cool new features. Especially the SPN has a lot to see forward to; we decided to hide most of its features and only make them visible once we know how to properly present them.

As always, we will keep you in the loop with everything that is happening on the [What's Next? page]({{ site.next_page_url }}) as well as via [our newsletter]({{ site.newsletter_url }}).

#### Thanks to Everyone Who Is Part of the Journey

We are super glad the SPN finally achieved this milestone and are hard at work pushing both the SPN and Portmaster into "Beta" and beyond. Thank you for your patience, your excitement, your support and your trust.
