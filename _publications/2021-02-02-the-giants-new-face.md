summary: "
<p>The Portmaster privacy app is one giant of a machine. But up until recently, most of its powers were not really usable. The features were either invisible or hidden behind a clunky old User Interface.</p>

<p>That is where Patrick comes along, who took charge of completely modernizing the Portmaster's User Interface. There is a lot to unravel here as Patrick gives us a good look at how it was to join Safing, how he felt when receiving this monumental task and how it was to work alongside Luke, the designer.</p>
