### Why? People Asked, So We Thought It Was Time to Test A Proper Sale

Ever since Portmaster Unlimited came out, people have been asking for sales. Would we offer discounted prices for Black Friday? What about reduced pricing for students? And Would Portmaster go on sale for for Christmas? So far, the answer has always been no. This changes today with the 69 Sale.

### 69 == mature?

Of course the 69 pricing is a bit silly, but it was too hard to resist, especially for Valentine's Day. Also we are all human and need some humor from time to time to brighten our days :) Hope you enjoy the deal & thank you all for your support!
