summary: "
<p>In this episode Daniel and I go to the root of how one should evaluate the trustworthiness of a company. We start off with the basics: how do businesses make money in general?</p><p>We then shift the conversation to the digital industry and inspect the dynamics of a field, where the cost of copying almost costs nothing. What did the industry do to still protect their intellectual property? And what problems came along with their success of doing just that?</p><p>We finish things off by talking about the counter-movement where companies try to regain consumer trust. But how do you evaluate these businesses? How can you be more confident in trusting them? And how did that perspective impact our decisions at Safing?</p>
