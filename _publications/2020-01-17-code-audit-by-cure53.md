summary: "
<p>Disclaimer: I'm not at my best today since been feeling a bit sick. I focused on bringing the episode out, so sorry for this weeks poor quality.</p>

<p>This week Daniel and David talk about the code review of the SPN cryptography module. The auditor is Cure53 who already has reviewed big players in the scene, such as Bitwarden, Mullvad or OpenPGP. First hints of the result are also included. Enjoy the listen.</p>
