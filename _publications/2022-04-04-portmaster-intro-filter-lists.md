Are you tired of not being in control over your data? You should give the Portmaster a try! It is an application firewall that will help you taking back your privacy.

In this video we show how you can easily block trackers with Portmaster. As trackers are already blocked by default, we will show this by enabled the NSFW (not suited for work) filter lists.
Then we take a quick look at the network monitor, where you can see the blocked connections.
