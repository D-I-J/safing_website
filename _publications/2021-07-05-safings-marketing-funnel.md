summary: "<p>Marketing is ever present. From the snake oil salesman who tricks people into buying useless stuff to the grand events hosted by the marketing mogul Apple to small companies trying to get some attention. One thing is certain: our attention is heavily fought over.</p>
<p>But with all the negative examples we experience, how can a company approach the topic marketing ethically? Dive into today's talk with David and Raphael who discuss Safing's approach to the topic and how we analyze the marketing funnel. How does a person move from never having heard of Safing to becoming a Portmaster user or even a paying customer?</p>
