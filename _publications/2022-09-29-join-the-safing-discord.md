### Get involved into Portmaster development through Discord 

Some team members wanted this for the longest time! So that we can share and interact more directly with you all, email is to silod off and sending a newsletter with draft designs seems unnatural as well, reddit is to public and twitter not conversational enough.

So Discord will be the place were we will share:
-	Pictures of upcoming designs
-	Do poles on ideas
-	Share concepts for new features

<br>
There will also be a place for the community to help each other, we as a team will also be in there, but we are currently very busy working on the Portmaster. By bringing you together we hope you get help faster.

### We want to get closer to the community

We thought about other alternatives, but settled on Discord, it is what most people already got.

So often when I tell people to vote for the Portmaster on alternativesto.net the answer is, no I don’t want to create a new account. Well on Discord you don’t have to, most got it already.

For those who don’t want to install their software, rest assured, discord works great via the browser – no install required.

### This is a trial – No Promises

We are not sure if we can handle this sort of community, as we are focused on developing the Portmaster.
Some of you already volunteered to help moderate the community and we appreciate this a lot!

But if this turns out to not work as intended we will close this server again.

### Special Areas for Portmaster Supporters

If you support our work we want to hear your voice loud and clear. This is why we will add an integration into the Safing account area, so you can tell us that you are a customer and want to get into those Discord rooms.

In those rooms you can help us in deciding where to expand the SPN next and give feedback on speed.
Some parts of the team already said they will mainly focus on those channels.

So hop on over, and invite others who are interested to https://discord.gg/safing
