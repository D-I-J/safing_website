We believe that transparency is an incomparably important aspect of running a privacy centered company. That is why we openly share where our funding comes from:

<div class="progress margin-bottom-40">
  <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-success" style="width: 21%">
    47.799€ Netidee funding
  </div>
  <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-primary" style="width: 79%">
    221.000€ Founder Investments (in Value)
  </div>
</div>

### Netidee funding <span class="small">2017</span>

This funding by [Netidee](https://www.netidee.at/) kickstarted the implementation of Safing (we've been working on first prototypes and the concept for some years).

### Founder Investments <span class="small">2018-2019</span>

As this investment is primarily done as work effort, the value shown is an estimation of what we would have earned working our normal job.

Early in 2018 all 3 Founders committed to invest two full years into the Project, while fully financing themselves through:

- personal savings and family support
- 20.000€ from [Fund of Excellence](https://www.fundofexcellence.com/erste-vision-capital/en/)
- Austrian founder program

  Calculation:
  Netidee: 47799€
  Personal Investments:
    - Equity: 5000€
    - 2 Years per Founder: 3000€ * 24 * 3 = 216000
  financed by:
    - personal savings
    - Fund of Excellence (20.000€)
    - Austrian founder program
