title: First Milestone Funded!

We've been successfully funded by [netidee.at](https://www.netidee.at/), a funding initiative by the [Internet Foundation Austria](https://www.nic.at/ipa/).
This gives us the opportunity to kick-start Safing, batteries (hardware and services) included, spanning from for January to December 2017.

We are looking forward to next year and the great time we will have implementing Safing.
