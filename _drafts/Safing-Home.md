Your digital safe harbor

## Take back control of your data.

<!-- We provide you with a simple but powerful tool that manages your connections to the Internet — protecting your privacy. [Learn about Port Master](#) -->

With the Portmaster you are back in charge of you digital self.
You can decide weather you want to share your data or not.

<!-- On top of that we make sure the data sent out is protected from prying eyes on the way to its destination. [Learn about Port 17](#) -->
To further protect your private data you can make use of Gate17. A privacy first network which enables you appear on 100+ places in the Web at the same time.

### Portmaster, Your application firewall
The Port Master ensures that applications only send data to service providers you trust. This way your device leaks no data. To ensure usability and effectiveness the firewall has pre-configured application profiles which know which connections are required for an optimal and private experience.

### Port17, Your secure network
The Port 17 Network ensures that the data you send out is safe ~~and private~~. While active, all your traffic is routed through the secure network, which makes your Internet traffic private and anonymous. As a result websites you visit do not know who you are (unless you tell them) or where you are located, nor does your Internet service provider (ISP) know where you connect to. And because your privacy is our top priority we built the whole system in such a way, that not even we can feasibly retrace the connections you made.

## Our Values
—

### Privacy First
We believe „everyone has the right to the protection of personal data“ (as stated in Article 8 of The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union). This has become increasingly difficult in an age where private data is being harvested in masses, also called [surveillance capitalism](/link—to-Shoshana-Zuboff-source-or-subpage).

Our mission at Safing is to make sure **everyone can protect their digital selves without making compromises in usability or privacy**. We give users back control over their data.

### Open Source
To ensure maximum privacy for our users and to build trust we need to be transparent in every aspect. That’s why we publish ~~all of our hard work~~ our software as open source. This way you can have a look at our source code and inspect if we truly stay to our word.

### Ethical Funding
Taking money always means opening up to influences. That is why we see it as our responsibility to be thoughtful about taking investments. We do not want parties to gain influence which do not or might not stand behind our values. That is why we choose to take more personal risks instead of selling parts of our company for easy money.

NOTES

Give you the opportunity to choose whome you want to share your data with.

Surveillance capitalism in short is the growth and income focus of capitalism paired with the information gathered from huge amounts of personal data. This combination results in more and better tracking of user behavior to exploit them financially.
