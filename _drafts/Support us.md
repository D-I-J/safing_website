## Transparent Funding Policy

For us, ethical funding also means we want to make sure that our users know who paid for the programs and services they use.

As a result we have adopted a transparent funding policy to openly share how we are funded. All our funding (and partnerships) will remain public!

## Clear Business Model

Instead of pushing a free product and worry about the business model later (cough - selling user data - cough) we want to have that part figured out right from the start. So this is how we’ll do it:

**Portmaster** is and always will be free. ‘Put you back in control of your data’ is our core vision, which is why we concluded to release Portmaster for free.

**Port17** will be a subscription based service. Of course we need to cover our costs and pay our bills. But more importantly we want to have the funds to further engage in our mission and to extend our services. That is why we decided on the subscription model - instead of building just on donations - which we feel would be infeasible.
