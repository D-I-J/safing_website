### Description

The SPN reached the closed pre-alpha which gives access to our Marvin and Visionary Kickstarter backers. Although this is a rough start, we are super pumped to have reached this new phase! Lots of bug fixes incoming.

We also released our take on a roadmap page, which we call the [Next Page]({{ site.next_page_url }}) where you can stay up to date on our progress and what we are currently working on.

Thanks for following, enjoy!
